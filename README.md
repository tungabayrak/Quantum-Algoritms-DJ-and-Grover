# Quantum-Algoritms-DJ-and-Grover

Detailed breakdown of Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover's Algorithms, and comparison with their classical counterpart algorithms.

With the advancements in Physics and Computation, Quantum mechanics provided new ways to perform computations. There are a wide range of problems where quantum approaches are exponentially faster solving a given computational problem than classical machines. Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover’s Algorithms are two of the initial algorithms introduced to the field, and that two algorithms give an insight for the potential of using Quantum Algorithms. Researching the algorithms and understanding how they work in detail allowed us to understand the story behind the advantage they have. In this paper, we looked through detailed breakdowns of Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover’s Allgorithms, including a side-by-side comparison of the quantum algorithm and its classical counterpart. The future of this field offers significant andvancements in computation power of machines and Quantum Computers will continue to outperfom Classical Computers in solving complex computational problems, such as simulations, making use of the quantum phenomena.
